            <h1>Google Merchandise Traffic Analysis</h1>
            <time>Data Analytics Project - 2023</time>

            <p>
                Data Analytics focuses on gaining insights about current situations by analyzing datasets 
                from past to present, enabling informed decision-making and solution development for existing problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                This case study analyzes traffic from the Google Merchandise Demo Account.
            </p>

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>

            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>
                Companies often possess data containing hidden information. Asking the right questions and 
                analyzing data reveals relevant insights. The goal is to answer questions that help companies 
                make informed decisions.
            </p>

            <h3>Result</h3>
            <p>
                Results are presented in a report with recommendations and follow-up steps. Based on this report, 
                clear, well-founded decisions can be made, costs can be saved, and processes optimized.
            </p>

            <h3>Duration</h3>
            <p>
                Project duration ranges from 2 weeks to 2 months. Completion time is fastest when data is 
                readily available and properly cleaned.
            </p>

            <h2>Case: Optimizing the Sales Funnel</h2>
            <p>
                The website owner wanted to identify where users drop out during the ordering process and 
                whether distinctions could be made between different customer types. According to the analysis, 
                optimizing the sales funnel could potentially increase revenue by 5.8%.
            </p>

            <h2>Number of Visitors</h2>
            <p>
                Comparing 2021-2022 data shows the website performed well - both new and returning users 
                increased significantly between the years.
            </p>

            <img src="../analytics1.png" alt="Visitor growth comparison">

            <p>
                However, deeper examination revealed the e-commerce conversion rate actually dropped despite 
                increased user numbers - an undesired outcome indicating fewer orders.
            </p>

            <img src="../analytics2.png" alt="Conversion rate analysis">

            <h2>Sales Funnel Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Google Analytics easily visualized the sales funnel, showing where visitors dropped out 
                and how they behaved on the website.
            </p>

            <img src="../analytics3.png" alt="Sales funnel visualization">

            <p>
                The visualization shows significant visitor drop-off during the first funnel stage due to 
                required sign-in. Improvements could include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementing guest checkout feature</li>
                <li>Fixing redirect behavior - when users sign in from cart, redirect back to cart instead of the store</li>
                <li>These changes improve efficiency and website performance</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Channel Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Which channels are most used by users?
            </p>

            <img src="../analytics4.png" alt="Channel performance">

            <p>
                Channel analysis revealed major issues. While direct channels dominated, and paid search 
                and display performed well, other channels underperformed. Improvements could include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhancing social media presence through influencer partnerships</li>
                <li>Optimizing underutilized channels with growth potential</li>
                <li>Strategic influencer selection could dramatically increase sales</li>
            </ul>
