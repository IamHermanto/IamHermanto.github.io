        <p>
          The email came through today. I've been accepted into the Master of 
          Computing and Innovation program at the University of Adelaide!

        <h2>The Program</h2>

          2 years of postgraduate study in Computer Science. Covers distributed 
          systems, machine learning, software engineering, and includes an 
          internship component.
        </p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Accept the offer</li>
          <li>Pay the deposit</li>
          <li>Apply for student visa</li>
          <li>Find accommodation in Adelaide</li>
          <li>Figure out how to juggle work and study</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mixed Feelings</h2>
        <p>
          Excited, terrified, hopeful. This is a huge investment - financially 
          and personally. Leaving everything behind. But it feels right.
        </p>

        <p>
          Adelaide, here I come.
