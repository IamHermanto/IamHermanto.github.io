        <h1>AI is Actually Getting Good Now</h1>
        <time>Apr 10, 2024</time>

        <p>
          Remember when I said AI was overhyped? I'm starting to change my mind. 
          The progress in the last year has been insane.
        </p>

        <h2>What Changed</h2>
        <p>
          Large Language Models like GPT-4 and Claude can now:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Write decent code (with supervision)</li>
          <li>Explain complex concepts clearly</li>
          <li>Help with debugging</li>
          <li>Draft documentation</li>
          <li>Generate test cases</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How I'm Using It</h2>
        <p>
          I've started using AI assistants in my daily work:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Claude for code explanations and debugging</li>
          <li>Generating boilerplate code</li>
          <li>Writing documentation</li>
          <li>Brainstorming solutions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Catch</h2>
        <p>
          It's not magic. You still need to understand the code. AI makes mistakes 
          and hallucinates. But as an assistant, as a rubber duck that talks back? 
          It's genuinely useful now.
        </p>

        <p>
          The developers who learn to use these tools effectively will have a 
          significant advantage.
