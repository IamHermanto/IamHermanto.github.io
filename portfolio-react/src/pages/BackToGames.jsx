        <h1>Getting Back Into Game Development</h1>
        <time>Nov 20, 2024</time>

        <p>
          The spark is back. After months of pure academic grind, I opened 
          Unity again last weekend. It felt like coming home.
        </p>

        <h2>What Changed</h2>
        <p>
          Semester break gave me breathing room. No assignments, reduced work 
          hours. I had time to actually think about what I enjoy.
        </p>

        <p>
          And what I enjoy is making games.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Project</h2>
        <p>
          Working on a small pixel art game. Nothing ambitious - just a simple 
          2D platformer. But it's mine, and it's fun.
        </p>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Burnout is real - respect it</li>
          <li>Breaks are necessary, not lazy</li>
          <li>Passion projects keep you sane</li>
          <li>Small progress is still progress</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I'm not abandoning web development or my career path. But I need 
          creative outlets too. Game dev is that for me.
