        <h1>Communication is the Skill Nobody Teaches You</h1>
        <time>Jan 5, 2026</time>

        <p>
          You can be the best coder in the room and still get passed over for 
          promotions because you can't explain what you built. I've seen it happen. 
          Hell, I've been that person.
        </p>

        <h2>The Intern Who Made Me Feel Inadequate</h2>
        <p>
          I recently interviewed someone for an intern position at my game studio. 
          This guy blew me away - not with his technical skills, but with how he 
          communicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          He explained his thought process clearly. No "uhh" or "umm." No awkward 
          pauses where he lost his train of thought. When I asked a question, he 
          answered it directly, then elaborated. Everything was structured, 
          confident, articulate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat there thinking: I can't even do that. And I'm the one conducting 
          the interview.
        </p>

        <h2>Work Communication vs Interview Communication</h2>
        <p>
          Here's the weird thing - I'm actually decent at communication during work. 
          I know the basics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't sit on blockers. Reach out immediately.</li>
          <li>Don't work in isolation. Share what you're doing.</li>
          <li>Ask questions. Being shy helps nobody.</li>
          <li>Keep people informed. Don't surprise them at the last minute.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I do all of that. I'm not the guy who disappears for a week and comes 
          back with something nobody asked for.
        </p>
        <p>
          But put me in an interview? Different story. The questions are tricky. 
          They want you to think on your feet, structure your answer on the spot, 
          sound confident while your brain is scrambling. That's where I fall apart.
        </p>

        <h2>It's Not an English Thing</h2>
        <p>
          I'd be just as bad in my native language. Some people can organize their 
          thoughts instantly and express them clearly. I stumble, backtrack, use 
          filler words, and lose my train of thought mid-sentence.
        </p>

        <h2>The Gap</h2>
        <p>
          Async communication - Slack, emails, documentation - I can do. I have 
          time to think, revise, structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Real-time verbal communication under pressure? That's the gap I need 
          to close.
        </p>
        <p>
          No idea how to fix it other than practice. More mock interviews. More 
          presentations. More putting myself in uncomfortable situations until 
          they become comfortable.
