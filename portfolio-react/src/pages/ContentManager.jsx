        <h1>New Job: Website Content Manager at Cloudary</h1>
        <time>Apr 20, 2023</time>

        <p>
          Finally landed a job! Website Content Manager at Cloudary Corporation. 
          Not exactly what I studied for, but it's something.
        </p>

        <h2>The Role</h2>
        <p>
          Managing the company's WordPress site, updating content daily in both 
          Chinese and English, working with design teams on UX improvements. 
          It's an easy job honestly.
        </p>

        <h2>The Secret</h2>
        <p>
          I automated most of my tasks. Wrote scripts to handle repetitive updates. 
          Set up templates for common content types. Now I have a lot of free time 
          which I spend:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Coding personal projects</li>
          <li>Studying AI and machine learning</li>
          <li>Making games in Unity</li>
          <li>Learning new technologies</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It's not my dream job, but it pays the bills and gives me time to grow. 
          I'll take it.
