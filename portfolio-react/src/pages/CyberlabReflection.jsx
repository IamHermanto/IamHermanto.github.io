        <h1>Reflections on My CyberLab Internship</h1>
        <time>Oct 1, 2025</time>

        <p>
          Three months at CyberLab. The internship is wrapping up. Here's what 
          I learned.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Growth</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Unity at a professional level (not just hobby projects)</li>
          <li>Docker and containerization in production</li>
          <li>Ansible for automated deployment</li>
          <li>Working with research requirements (very different from commercial)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Communicating with researchers (translating requirements to code)</li>
          <li>Documentation (academics love documentation)</li>
          <li>Working independently with minimal supervision</li>
          <li>Presenting technical work to non-technical stakeholders</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Surprised Me</h2>
        <p>
          Research environments move slower than startups but are more thorough. 
          There's more freedom to explore solutions, but also more pressure to 
          justify decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>What's Next</h2>
        <p>
          Finishing my degree, then job hunting. This internship will look good 
          on the resume. More importantly, it showed me I can do real engineering work.
