        <h1>New Chapter: Internship at CyberLab</h1>
        <time>Jul 10, 2025</time>

        <p>
          Big news! I've secured an internship at CyberLab, the cybersecurity 
          research lab at University of Adelaide. This means I had to leave 
          Moximo, which was bittersweet.
        </p>

        <h2>What is CyberLab?</h2>
        <p>
          It's a research facility focused on cybersecurity and simulation. 
          They do work for government, defense, and industry. Very different 
          from the B2B web apps I was building at Moximo.
        </p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity Engineer (intern). Working on simulation systems, 
          building tools, and contributing to research projects.
        </p>

        <h2>The Stack</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Unity 3D for simulations</li>
          <li>Python/Flask for backend services</li>
          <li>Docker for containerization</li>
          <li>Linux everything</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Nervous but excited. This is real engineering work.
