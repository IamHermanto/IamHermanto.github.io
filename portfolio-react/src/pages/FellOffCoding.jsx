        <h1>I Fell Off From Coding</h1>
        <time>Oct 15, 2024</time>

        <p>
          Confession time: I've barely written any personal code in months. 
          Between university assignments, work, and hospitality, I have no 
          energy left for side projects.
        </p>

        <h2>What Happened</h2>
        <p>
          University here is heavily theoretical. Algorithms, math, proofs. 
          Very different from the practical coding I was doing at Moximo. 
          By the time I'm done with assignments, the last thing I want to 
          do is look at more code.
        </p>

        <h2>The Guilt</h2>
        <p>
          I feel guilty. I used to code for fun - games, experiments, learning 
          new frameworks. Now coding feels like work. Like obligation.
        </p>

        <h2>Is This Burnout?</h2>
        <p>
          Maybe. Or maybe it's just a phase. I need to remind myself that it's 
          okay to take a break. The passion will come back. It always does.
        </p>

        <p>
          For now, I'm focusing on surviving the semester.
