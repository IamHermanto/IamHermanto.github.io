        <h1>Hiring Interns for My Game Studio - The Process</h1>
        <time>Jan 2, 2026</time>

        <p>
          I'm on the other side of the hiring table now. Looking for interns 
          to help with the game studio. It's eye-opening.
        </p>

        <h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Passion over polish:</strong> Show me you love games, not just that you need a job</li>
          <li><strong>Projects:</strong> Anything. A game jam entry. A half-finished prototype. Something.</li>
          <li><strong>Willingness to learn:</strong> You won't know everything. That's fine. Can you learn?</li>
          <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Remote work requires good communication</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I'm NOT Looking For</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Generic applications that could be sent to anyone</li>
          <li>Resumes with no projects or portfolio</li>
          <li>People who just want "game dev" on their resume</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Irony</h2>
        <p>
          Now I understand why my job applications get rejected. When you 
          see 50 applications and only 2-3 stand out, you get it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Time to improve my own applications too.
