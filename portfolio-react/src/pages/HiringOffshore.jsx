        <h1>Hiring Offshore - Lessons Learned</h1>
        <time>Jan 4, 2026</time>

        <p>
          For my game studio, I've been exploring offshore hiring. Here's what I've learned.
        </p>

        <h2>Don't Lower Your Bar</h2>
        <p>
          If you wouldn't hire them at onshore rates, don't hire them just 
          because they're cheaper. Sub-par developers are a drain on the team 
          at any cost.
        </p>

        <h2>Communication is Critical</h2>
        <p>
          No amount of technical skill compensates for communication issues. 
          They must be able to communicate clearly in writing and on calls.
        </p>

        <h2>Over-Communicate Early</h2>
        <p>
          I've noticed offshore developers being reluctant to ask for help. 
          Insist on daily check-ins initially. Let go gradually as they 
          get comfortable.
        </p>

        <h2>Encourage Push-Back</h2>
        <p>
          Offshore hires tend to just do whatever they're asked. But you don't 
          want yes-men. Encourage them to challenge your ideas. Praise it 
          when they do.
        </p>

        <h2>Be Patient</h2>
        <p>
          Among billions of people globally, there are millions of great 
          programmers. If you're not finding them, your hiring bar or 
          process needs work.
