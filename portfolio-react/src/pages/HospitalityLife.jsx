        <h1>Hospitality Work in Australia - Everyone is Miserable</h1>
        <time>Aug 10, 2024</time>

        <p>
          I'm now in Adelaide, working part-time in hospitality while studying. 
          I like cooking. I thought hospitality might be okay.
        </p>

        <p>I was wrong.</p>

        <h2>The Reality</h2>
        <p>
          Cooking at home is relaxing. Cooking in a commercial kitchen during 
          rush hour is pure chaos. The heat, the pressure, the endless stream 
          of orders.
        </p>

        <p>
          And everyone - EVERYONE - seems miserable. The chefs are stressed, 
          the wait staff are exhausted, the managers are overwhelmed. I've yet 
          to meet someone who genuinely enjoys working in hospitality.
        </p>

        <h2>Why People Do It</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Flexible hours (good for students)</li>
          <li>Cash in hand sometimes</li>
          <li>No better options</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Take</h2>
        <p>
          It's a means to an end. The pay is okay, the hours fit around my 
          classes, and it keeps me fed. But this is definitely not a long-term 
          career path for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          Motivates me to get that tech job even more.
