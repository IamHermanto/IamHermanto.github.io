        <h1>Job Hunting Again - It's Still Hard</h1>
        <time>Dec 15, 2025</time>

        <p>
          Fresh graduate (again), job hunting (again). You'd think it gets 
          easier with more experience and a Master's degree. It doesn't.
        </p>

        <h2>The Current Market</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Tech layoffs have flooded the market with experienced developers</li>
          <li>Companies want 3+ years experience for "junior" roles</li>
          <li>Visa sponsorship is rare</li>
          <li>Competition is brutal</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Stats So Far</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Applications sent: 50+</li>
          <li>Responses: ~10</li>
          <li>Interviews: 3</li>
          <li>Offers: 0</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I'm Doing Differently</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Tailoring each application (no mass spraying)</li>
          <li>Building in public (this blog, portfolio)</li>
          <li>Networking at meetups</li>
          <li>Working on backup plans</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Rejection is part of the process. Keep going.
