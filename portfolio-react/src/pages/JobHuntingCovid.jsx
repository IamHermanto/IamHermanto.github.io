        <h1>Job Hunting During COVID - The Struggle is Real</h1>
        <time>Mar 10, 2022</time>

        <p>
          Graduated. Applied to jobs. Got an offer from a multinational company. 
          Hoped for better offers. They never came.
        </p>

        <h2>The Reality</h2>
        <p>
          COVID destroyed the job market. Companies froze hiring. Remote work became 
          the norm, which meant competing with candidates globally. Fresh graduates 
          like me were at the bottom of the pile.
        </p>

        <p>
          I went back to my home country hoping it would be easier to find work. 
          Applied to everything - data analytics, web development, IT support. 
          Most applications went into a black hole.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The job market doesn't care about your GPA</li>
          <li>Connections matter more than skills sometimes</li>
          <li>Being picky is a luxury you can't afford as a fresh grad</li>
          <li>Rejection is normal - don't take it personally</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Still searching. Still hopeful. Something will come up eventually.
