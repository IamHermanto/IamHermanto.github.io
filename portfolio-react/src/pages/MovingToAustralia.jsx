        <h1>The Dream: Moving to Australia</h1>
        <time>May 15, 2024</time>

        <p>
          I've been thinking about this for a while. I want out of the third world. 
          Not because I hate my country, but because I want better opportunities, 
          better quality of life, and honestly, a fresh start.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Australia?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Strong tech industry</li>
          <li>Good work-life balance (so I've heard)</li>
          <li>English speaking</li>
          <li>Pathway to permanent residency through study</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Plan</h2>
        <p>
          Apply for a Master's degree. Get a student visa. Study while working part-time. 
          Graduate and get a post-study work visa. Find a job. Eventually, PR.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's a long road. Expensive too. But I've saved up, and Moximo is open 
          to me working remotely. This might actually be possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Time to start the applications.
