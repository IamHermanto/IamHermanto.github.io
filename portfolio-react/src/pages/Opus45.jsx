        <h1>Claude Opus 4.5 is Here - First Impressions</h1>
        <time>Jan 4, 2026</time>

        <p>
          Anthropic just released Claude Opus 4.5. As someone who uses Claude 
          daily for coding, I had to try it immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>What's New</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Better at following complex instructions</li>
          <li>Improved code generation quality</li>
          <li>Longer context window</li>
          <li>Better at maintaining consistency in long conversations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Testing</h2>
        <p>
          I gave it some of my trickier coding problems - the ones where 
          previous versions would get confused or lose context.
        </p>

        <p>
          Result: noticeably better. Not perfect, still needs verification, 
          but the quality jump is real.
        </p>

        <h2>For Developers</h2>
        <p>
          If you're not using AI coding assistants yet, you're falling behind. 
          The gap between AI-assisted and non-AI-assisted developers is growing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Learn to use these tools. They're only getting better.
