        <h1>Plan A, Plan B, Plan C - Hedging My Bets</h1>

        <p>
          I'm not putting all my eggs in one basket. Here are my concurrent plans.
        </p>

        <h2>Plan A: Find a Tech Job</h2>
        <p>
          The traditional path. Keep applying, keep interviewing, keep networking. 
          A fullstack or frontend role at a good company would be ideal.
        </p>

        <h2>Plan B: Build My Own Business</h2>
        <p>
          The game studio. If I can build something that generates revenue, even 
          modest revenue, I can be my own boss. Control my own destiny.
        </p>

        <h2>Plan C: Hospitality</h2>
        <p>
          Not glamorous, but it pays the bills. I can always pick up more shifts 
          while working on Plans A and B. It's a safety net.
        </p>

        <h2>The Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          Work all three simultaneously. Morning: job applications and interviews. 
          Afternoon: game development. Evening: hospitality shifts if needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of these has to work out. Right?
