        <h1>Juggling Remote Work, Study, and Hospitality</h1>
        <time>Sep 5, 2024</time>

        <p>
          My current schedule is insane. Remote work for Moximo, Master's degree 
          at Adelaide, and part-time hospitality shifts. Here's how I'm (barely) 
          surviving.
        </p>

        <h2>A Typical Week</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Morning:</strong> University lectures or study</li>
          <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Remote work for Moximo (Laravel, PHP)</li>
          <li><strong>Evening/Weekend:</strong> Hospitality shifts</li>
          <li><strong>Night:</strong> Assignments, more work, sleep deprivation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Helps</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Moximo is flexible with hours (thank god)</li>
          <li>Time zone difference means I can work Australian evening = their morning</li>
          <li>Coffee. Lots of coffee.</li>
          <li>Very strict calendar management</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Suffers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Sleep</li>
          <li>Social life</li>
          <li>Personal projects (game dev on pause)</li>
          <li>My sanity, occasionally</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It's temporary. Just need to get through the degree.
