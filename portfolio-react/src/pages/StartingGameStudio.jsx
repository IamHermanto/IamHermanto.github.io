        <h1>I'm Starting My Own Game Studio</h1>
        <time>Dec 28, 2025</time>

        <p>
          Plot twist: instead of just looking for a job, I'm starting my own 
          game studio. Plan B is becoming Plan A.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Now?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Job market is brutal anyway</li>
          <li>I have time while waiting for visa</li>
          <li>I've been making games for years - why not try to make money from it?</li>
          <li>Worst case, it's a portfolio piece</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Plan</h2>
        <p>
          Start small. Indie games. Build a team of like-minded people. 
          Release something, learn from it, iterate.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Project: Apocalypso</h2>
        <p>
          A pixel art survival game I've been prototyping. Nothing fancy, 
          but it's a start. If I can get a vertical slice done and maybe 
          a demo on Steam...
        </p>

        <h2>Reality Check</h2>
        <p>
          Most game studios fail. Most indie games don't make money. I know 
          the odds. But I'd rather try and fail than always wonder "what if."
