        <h1>University of Adelaide - Disappointing but It's Fine</h1>
        <time>Nov 10, 2025</time>

        <p>
          Hot take: the Master's program at Adelaide has been... underwhelming. 
          But I'm still glad I did it.
        </p>

        <h2>The Disappointments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Heavy on theory, light on practical application</li>
          <li>Some outdated curriculum</li>
          <li>Group projects where I do most of the work</li>
          <li>Expensive for what you get</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Silver Linings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The visa and pathway to work in Australia</li>
          <li>CyberLab internship (wouldn't have happened otherwise)</li>
          <li>Networking with other international students</li>
          <li>Forced me to learn things I wouldn't have on my own</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Perspective</h2>
        <p>
          I came here for the opportunity, not the education itself. The degree 
          is a means to an end - the end being a career in Australia.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm enjoying my life here. Working, coding, making games on the side. 
          The university experience isn't what I hoped for, but the overall 
          experience of being here is worth it.
