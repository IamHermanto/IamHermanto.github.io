        <h1>Applying for the Graduate Visa</h1>

        <p>
          The post-study work visa (subclass 485) is my ticket to staying in 
          Australia. Here's the process.
        </p>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Australian qualification (check)</li>
          <li>Under 50 years old (check)</li>
          <li>English proficiency (check)</li>
          <li>Health insurance</li>
          <li>Police clearance</li>
          <li>$1,895 application fee</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What It Gives You</h2>
        <p>
          2-4 years of unrestricted work rights in Australia, depending on 
          your qualification and where you studied. For me, it should be 
          2 years minimum.
        </p>

        <h2>The Stress</h2>
        <p>
          Your entire future depends on a bureaucratic process. The waiting, 
          the uncertainty, the fear of rejection. It's not fun.
        </p>

        <p>
          But it's the path I chose. Now I wait.
