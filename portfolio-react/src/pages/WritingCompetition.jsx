        <h1>I Won Third Place in a Writing Competition!</h1>
        <time>Feb 15, 2020</time>

        <p>
          Remember when I said I started writing for fun? Well, I entered a 
          short story competition on a whim and somehow placed third!
        </p>

        <h2>The Experience</h2>
        <p>
          It was a local competition with about 200 entries. The theme was 
          "new beginnings" which felt appropriate given everything happening 
          in the world right now.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spent two weeks on a 5,000 word story. Revised it probably 20 times. 
          Had friends read it and give feedback. The process taught me a lot 
          about editing and killing your darlings.
        </p>

        <h2>What This Means</h2>
        <p>
          Not much, honestly. It's a small competition. But it's validation that 
          maybe I don't completely suck at this. I'll keep writing, keep making 
          games, and keep studying. Life is too short to only do one thing.
